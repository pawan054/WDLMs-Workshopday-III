# WDLMs-Workshopday-III
Hello, Namaste! to everyone. Hope you all are fine.
Also, Welcome to this repository-WDLMs-Workshopday-III.
This repository contains the notebook for implementation of Machine Learning (ML) model-Linear Regression Model in material science to calculate electronegativity if half hesular alloys,
LR model is underfitting and not predictive.
All mail steps are suggest how to carry out
This notebook is presented in workshop (To view the recorded video, please visit the git hub page of amrl-cdp tu).
In this repository, I have mentioned those files that I introduced in the "Workshop on Deep Learning in Material Sciecne" at central Department of Physics, Tribhuwan University. 
Just to use these files, click on the files and look for preview.
